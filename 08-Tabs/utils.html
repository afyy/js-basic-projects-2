<!-- history -->
<p>
  Cappadocia region was formed 60 million years ago by erosion of soft 
  layers of lava and ash from Mount Erciyes (Argeus), Mount Hasan and 
  Mount Güllü composing with wind and rain over millions of years.
  Human settlement at the Cappadocia region dates back to the Paleolithic 
  era. The lands where the Hittites once lived have been one of the most 
  important centers of Christianity in the later periods. Houses and 
  churches carved into the caves and rocks turned the region into a huge 
  heaven for Christians escaping from the dominance of the Roman Empire.
